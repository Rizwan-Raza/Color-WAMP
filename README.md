## Frequently Asked Questions 

### Does this theme work with newest WP version and also older versions?
Yes, this theme works really fine with WordPress 5.1!
It also works great with WP 5.0 - and also should with WP 3.1 - but we only tested extensively with WP 5.1 and 5.1.1 So you always should run the latest WordPress version for a lot of reasons.
