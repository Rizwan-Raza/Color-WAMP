== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with newest WP version and also older versions? =
Yes, this plugin works really fine with WordPress 5.1!
It also works great with WP 5.0 - and also should with WP 4.8 - but we only tested extensively with WP 5.1 and 5.1.1 So you always should run the latest WordPress version for a lot of reasons.
